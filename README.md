OCD Healthcare Data Interactive Dashboard Summary

I developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to analyze healthcare data related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Using SQL, I extracted key insights to visualize patterns and trends within the dataset. The dashboard highlights:

1. Gender distribution of OCD diagnoses and average obsession scores by gender.

2. OCD counts and average obsession scores across different ethnic groups.

3. A breakdown of female OCD patients and their obsession scores by ethnicity.

4. A breakdown of male OCD patients and their obsession scores by ethnicity.

5. Yearly totals of OCD diagnoses.

6. The most common obsession type and its average obsession score.

7. The most common compulsion type and its average obsession score.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how OCD presents across various demographics and over time, supporting deeper analysis and data-driven decision-making.
